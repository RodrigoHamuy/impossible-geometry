# ImpossibleGeometry

## New TODO

- Add Player (remove auto player)
- Add Target (remove auto target)
- On Hit Play Ask to Add Player/Target
- Edit rotate block
- Block Grid view (kinda mesh view)

## Remember to write

- UI Development
    - First you were able to choose what block to spawn
        - That resulted in to many options showing on screen
    - Now you can only spawn blocks and then you are able to transform them into...
        - Half blocks
        - Rotatable elements (and add rotation handles anywhere in the scene)
- Action Manager
    - Remember each edit action
    - Each blocks contains a reference to it's own prefab
